# mystery_driver

This is a game where the player has 6 guesses to name one of the 55 drivers that have driven at least a single race since 2014.

Each guess will either deliver the message "You Win" or information regarding the team, flag driven under, year of first f1 race, birth year, car number, and number of race wins.

After 6 guesses, the player will lose if they have not gotten the correct guess.
